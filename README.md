Pinax Forums
============

This is an open-source forums project in progress, built on
[agora](https://github.com/eldarion/agora)
and a number of other apps in the Pinax ecosystem.

Our goals with this project are to both provide scaffolding for the further
development of a variety of reusable apps for Pinax as well as a project that
can be used out-of-the-box or with minor customization as a clean,
feature-rich forums platform.
